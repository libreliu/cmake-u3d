# cmake-u3d

This is the CMake version of U3D Sample Software (IFX Toolkit based, that's why so many "IFX"es here), with CMakeLists.txt from scratch.

Thanks to [ningfei/u3d](https://github.com/ningfei/u3d) where a version with IFX{Core, Importing, Exporting} is present, but not the IFXRendering nor the SampleViewer.

This version includes the `SampleViewerWin32`, to help gain more on developing U3D IFX-complicant rendering codes.

This code requires Visual Studio 2019 and Windows SDK to build.
