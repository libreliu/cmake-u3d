How To Generate HTML_U3D on Win32
=================================

1.  Obtain and install a copy of doxygen from http://www.doxygen.org/.  We 
    last used version 1.3.7.  It should automatically add the directory that 
    doxygen.exe resides in to your system's PATH environment variable.

2.  Obtain and install a copy of Graphviz from 
    http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html to your C drive 
    in its default directory.  The U3D.cfg & Test.cfg doxygen configuration files
    are hardcoded based on the default install directory.

3.  If you wish to create a compressed HTML file from the doxygen output, 
    obtain and install a copy of Microsoft*'s HTML Help Workshop from (note the 
    following URL text on multiple indented lines should be concatenated):  

        http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?
        url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp

4.  With the most recent version of the source, run the MakeDocsU3D batch file by 
    double clicking on it in the "Docs\Doxygen" directory.  Another approach is 
    to change to the proper directory in a DOS command prompt window and then 
    issue a "MakeSpecifiedDocs U3D" command.

    This will take about 30 minutes to complete and will create all of the HTML 
    for U3D in the "Docs\Doxygen\Output" directory in an automatically created 
    subdirectory called "HTML_U3D".

5.  To create a .CHM compressed HTML file, run the "HTML Help Workshop" program 
    from the Start menu.

6.  Create the compiled U3D help file from the File\Compile dialog box by 
    selecting the index.hhp file from the HTML_U3D subdirectory.  This will create 
    the compiled file called index.chm in that directory.

7.  Manually copy the index.chm file and rename it to HTML_U3D.chm or U3D.chm.


How to Generate Test HTML on Win32 When Learning doxygen
========================================================

1.  Follow steps 1-3 above.

2.  Place all the desired source files to use for generating documentation in a 
    "Source\Tests\doxygen" subdirectory.  It's okay for it to be organized in 
    multiple nested subdirectories.

3.  Run the MakeDocsTest batch file by double clicking on it in the 
    "Docs\Doxygen" directory.  This will create all of the HTML and place 
    it in the "Docs\Doxygen\Output" directory in an automatically created 
    subdirectory called "HTML_Test".
